This has always been something that's bothered me because I constantly install new third-party macOS apps and software. These apps often add new global hotkeys that I think I'll remember at the time, but never do. This leads to confusion later when I'm trying to assign a keyboard shortcut somewhere, only to find it's already taken. Then I have to painstakingly trawl through dozens of apps to find the offending party. This app will let me quickly see at a glance which keyboard shortcuts are taken, what keys are overused, and what keys might still be free for a good potential future shortcut.

> [!NOTE]
> There isn't really an automated way to expose configured hotkeys in macOS, so this app requires manual entry as you use new apps.
